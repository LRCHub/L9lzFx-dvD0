[00:00.59] Save me from drowning in the sea
[00:05.18] Beat me up on the beach
[00:10.20] What a lovely holiday
[00:12.89] There's nothing funny left to say
[00:29.39] 
[00:19.46] This sombre song won't drain the sun
[00:24.24] But it won't shine until it's sung
[00:29.19] No water running in the stream
[00:32.09] The saddest place we've ever seen
[00:48.59] 
[00:38.74] Everything I touched was golden
[00:42.00] Everything I loved got broken
[00:44.46] On the road to mandalay
[00:48.79] Every mistake I've ever made
[00:51.47] Has been rehashed and then replayed
[00:54.19] As I got lost along the way
[01:07.69] 
[00:57.04] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[01:01.80] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[01:06.71] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[01:12.09] Bom badom
[01:16.59] 
[01:17.41] There's nothing left for you to give
[01:22.52] The truth is all that you're left with
[01:27.10] Twenty paces then at dawn
[01:30.33] We will die and be reborn
[01:42.83] 
[01:37.05] I like to sleep beneath the trees
[01:41.80] Have the universe at one with me
[01:46.72] Look down the barrel of a gun
[01:49.62] And feel the moon replace the sun
[02:06.12] 
[01:56.35] Everything we've ever stolen
[01:59.02] Has been lost, returned or broken
[02:01.46] No more dragons left to slay
[02:05.70] Every mistake I've ever made
[02:08.50] Has been rehashed and then replayed
[02:11.46] As I got lost along the way
[02:24.96] 
[02:14.69] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:19.19] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:24.55] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:29.65] Bom badom
[02:34.15] 
[02:33.94] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:38.54] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:43.64] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:48.48] Bom badom
[02:52.98] 
[02:53.54] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[02:58.11] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[03:03.27] Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
[03:07.82] Bom badom
[03:12.32] 
[03:33.22] Save me from drowning in the sea
[03:38.14] Beat me up on the beach
[03:42.76] What a lovely holiday
[03:45.67] There's nothing funny left to say
